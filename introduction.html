<p>Welcome to Discover Catholic Business!</p><p>  My name is Zachary. I’ve been kicking around this idea of a Catholic-oriented business for years, but I couldn’t quite peg down what it would be that I could do, or what I could offer. I wanted to bring my day-to-day work closer to Christ. To sanctify our work is something we can and should aim for, no matter what that work might be, no matter our vocation, occupation, or station in life.  I decided the best thing to do would be to act as a conduit, connecting Catholic business and vocational ventures, using my skills to serve Christ and His Holy Will.</p>


<p>Though I’d been in business for myself for a few years, I still felt unsatisfied with the lines of work I had been pursuing. I sought something that could more easily put me in line with the values of the Catholic Church and her teachings. I’d become tired and weary of the world of maximizing profits and “growth” for the sake of growth, where business owners and employees alike work without thought or concern for the long-term effects of their actions or outcomes. Businesses have many great responsibilities, and I yearned to push forward towards the real goal—the salvation and sanctification of souls. Seeking something more mindful, fulfilling, and aimed at the true end goal of our lives brought me to this endeavor.</p>

<p>After months of prayer and contemplation, I decided to just go out and see if others also believed in connecting Catholic-owned and Catholic-operated businesses, in building a community together, in helping one another achieve their various goals, to build a great fellowship. To my surprise, I found an immediate interest in building such a community! I decided to set off on this venture and got straight to work.</p>

<p>As someone who takes the interior life very seriously, I sought out the guidance and intercession of Saint Joseph, Mary’s Most Chaste Spouse, and Saint Josemaría Escrivá, to guide my efforts. St. Joseph, the protector of the Blessed Mother and Christ, was not a priest, nor a king, nor a bishop nor Pope. He was a humble laborer, a carpenter, entrusted with raising and protecting Jesus, who spent some thirty years with him. I participated in a consecration to St. Joseph this past Winter and Spring. I believe we still have so much to learn from this great and humble servant—especially for those of us to partake in the world through our work. </p>
<p>St. Josemaría Escrivá was newer to me, a passionate saint who changed the way many Christians interact with God. So many of his writings have helped grow and better my understanding that my day, my every moment, can become a prayer of sorts, an offering to our Lord—that no matter the work, the job, the task at hand, it can all be a sacrifice if done with the proper intention and given with love. I could go on and on about these two saints, but I’ll save that for another time.</p>

<p>While formalizing and validating this idea, to connect Catholic business ventures in union under Christ, I kept these two saints as close to me as possible. With Discover Catholic Business, I wanted to create a place where people could discover and learn about Catholic businesses of all kinds. To build a space for community to happen that didn’t depend on a platform without our best intentions in mind nor heart. </p>
<p>I quickly figured out a simple directory for users to search through, so they could visually see what each business had to offer and where each laid on the map. With this directory, I knew I could help expand our exposure and shine a light on some great businesses serving our needs as customers in the market place. From sacramentals like Rosary makers, to insurance and real estate, professional services for business to business, artists and craftsman alike, teachers, and many other kinds of brothers and sisters in Christ. I’ve found a wonderful opportunity to help bring good people together, to grow their network, so more can discover what these great Catholic businesses are up to. In my experience of consulting with businesses, helping them grow in myriad ways, I knew I could offer a place for Catholic Businesses to tap into my experience and knowledge and aid them in their goals.</p>

<p>Our plans for this begin with our business directory. The first thing you see when you come to our website will be just that, the members of our community. We seek to help elevate these businesses by increasing their own “surface area”—the community exposure they have and spread across the world. By allowing people to discover goods and services by others who share the same values in Catholic Social Teaching. We will continue to share the stories of these businesses in our various channels, and highlighting their works on a continued basis. We also are building a private forum for our community members to partake in our resources we’ve been gathering and building for businesses. A major part of that is the services of other business owners looking to serve others. Participation in this community naturally leads to fellowship and sharing of knowledge and experiences as Catholic business owners.</p>

<p>My plans for Discover Catholic Business may be a grand in scope, I admit. I have much more planned, but we must walk before we can run, and this starts with building the foundations of a community looking to share its gifts and grow.</p>

<p>More shall come, especially as we promote and partner with Catholic charities and vocations. In our few months of opening up the directory and our members forum, our primary goal is to grow, allowing this venture to become self-sustaining, if it is God’s Will.  He will guide our roadmap as we go forward, in time.</p>

<p>If you are a Catholic Business owner, I personally invite you to join our directory and community! If you’re a Catholic charity, or vocational organization, please reach out and email us and we’ll add you into our new section of the directory designated for you!</p>
<p>God be with you.</p>
<p>-Zachary</p>
